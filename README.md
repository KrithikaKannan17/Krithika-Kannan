🚀 About My Work

💻 Projects & Hackathons

### Robotics Projects
I have hands-on experience in building and programming robots to solve real-world problems and demonstrate key concepts in technology. Some of my robotics projects include:

1. Following Traffic Lights: Developed a robot that detects and responds to traffic light signals, simulating real-world traffic scenarios.
2. NOR and AND Gate Simulation: Programmed robots to demonstrate the functionality of logic gates, bridging the gap between robotics and digital electronics.
3. Digital Lights with Breadboard and Quarky: Created interactive lighting systems using breadboards and Quarky, enhancing understanding of circuit connections.
4. Transistor Tap: Designed a sensor-based robot utilizing transistor logic for touch-based activation.
5. QR Navigation Robot: Built a robot capable of scanning QR codes for navigation and executing location-based tasks.
6. Edge Detector Robot: Engineered a robot to detect and navigate edges, preventing falls and enabling precise movement.
7. Line Follower Robot: Developed a bot programmed to follow a specific line path autonomously, emphasizing real-time path tracking.
